# About FOOlang
Foo-lang is a project dedicated to exploring the intricacies of creating an interpreted programming language from scratch. This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental components involved in building an interpreted language without relying on external packages or libraries.

# Key Features
Lexical Analysis: Tokenizing the input code to generate a sequence of tokens.

Parser: Analyzing the token sequence to construct an abstract syntax tree (AST).

# Purpose
The primary goal of Foo-lang is educational, offering insights into the process and challenges of language design and implementation. By working through this project, contributors and learners can gain hands-on experience with lexical analysis, parsing techniques, and the overall structure of an interpreter.
