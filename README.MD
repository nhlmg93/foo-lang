# About Foo-lang
Foo-lang is a project dedicated to exploring the intricacies of creating an interpreted programming language from scratch. This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental components involved in building an interpreted language without relying on external packages or libraries.

# Key Features
Lexical Analysis: Tokenizing the input code to generate a sequence of tokens.
Parser: Analyzing the token sequence to construct an abstract syntax tree (AST).

# Technology Used
Golang: The entire project is implemented using Go, leveraging its performance and concurrency capabilities to build efficient language processing components.

# Purpose
The primary goal of Foo-lang is educational, offering insights into the process and challenges of language design and implementation. By working through this project, contributors and learners can gain hands-on experience with lexical analysis, parsing techniques, and the overall structure of an interpreter.
